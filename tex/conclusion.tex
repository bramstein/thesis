\chapter{Conclusion}


One of the main advantages of the chart library is its component based nature. All of the components such as titles, legends, and even charts themselves can be moved around easily and laid out with a few lines of code. This makes the library very easy to modify and maintain. New components can be developed without any changes to existing components and---as long as they meet the simple interface requirements---can be integrated and laid out just as easily. The use of layout managers also proved to be very useful as it separates the layout algorithms from the components.

Another advantage is the plugin structure, which enables plugin authors to easily add new chart types. Authors will have all the standard components at their disposal, and basically only have declare which input they accept and then iterate through the data and draw the chart.

Whether or not the choice of using the HTML5 Canvas for drawing the charts is correct remains to be seen. Both SVG and Canvas currently have problems with browser support and interoperatibility (either something is not supported or implementations differ.) Currently the only safe choice would be to develop for both platforms until a clear winner has emerged (if there is such a thing.) The graphics module makes it easy to support both drawing APIs as it encapsulates and abstracts all drawing calls, shielding the rest of the chart library from "platform" specific APIs.

Alternatively, SVG could be used for static charts, while Canvas is used for dynamic charts. The SVG structure makes it easy to create static charts, while Canvas, with its low level API, makes animation (and performance) easier to achieve.

Compared to other chart libraries, features that stand out are the aforementioned component structure, accurate function plotting, crisp line drawing, and the plugin extension functions. The current code base is modular and easily extended, thus making it a good platform for further development.
