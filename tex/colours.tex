\section{Defaults}
The defaults "module" is not really a module, but a public object containing the default settings used in rendering charts. This includes colours, fonts, spacing between labels, point types and a list of all the available chart types. Users of the library can override any value in this object to suit their own needs.

The default colours come in two varieties: qualitative and diverging\cite{few08}. The qualitative set is used for displaying sub categories, to separate the items into distinct groups. The diverging set is used for encoding ranges, for example low to high. Both varieties have three subsets, one for highlighting values with strong hues and one for non-highlighted data with medium intensity hues. The last subset is a gray-scale version for printing. The hues themselves are taken from Cynthia Brewer's ColorBrewer application\footnote{\url{http://www.ColorBrewer.org} by Cynthia A. Brewer, Geography, Pennsylvania State University.}, which features many qualitative, sequential and diverging color palettes.

Other colours are kept muted \cite{tufte01, few08, stone06} so as to not distract from the data itself. Fonts default to simple black text, 11px in size and sans serif.
