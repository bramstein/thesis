\chapter{Design}
The design of the chart library is based on the concept of modules, pieces of self-contained code that interact with each other through public interfaces\footnote{This is similar to object oriented programming, I have not used that term here to avoid confusion with classical object oriented programming, which is not supported in JavaScript in favour of prototypical inheritance. For more information on classical inheritance versus prototypical inheritance see 
\cite{crockford08}.}.
