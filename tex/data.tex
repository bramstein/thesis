\section{Data}
The data module defines several data relationships their corresponding input formats and validation functions. The chart plug-ins use these relationship definitions to declare the input they accept. Because not every data relationship can be predefined the data module is made extensible so that custom relationships can be constructed while still using some of the built in functionality.

A chart plug-in is not limited to accepting a single data relationship, it can declare an array of (mutually exclusive) data relationships. The following sections explain the definitions and input formats of the available data relationships.

\subsection{Part to Whole}

\subsection{Correlation}

\subsection{Time Series}
